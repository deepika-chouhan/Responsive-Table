# Responsive-Table

## Available features
* `A search at the top level(A filter at the top level)`: on typing a few characters, a filtered result displayed. This filter should not be restricted to one particular column, i.e. all values (of all rows and columns) should be compared with the typed keyword
* `Column-level filters`: filters in each column that will filter values for that column.
* `Ability to sort`: on clicking on the table header, the table gets sorted based on the character/number in that column. On the first click, the order is ascending, and on the next subsequent clicks, the order would be alternate between descending and ascending.


### Perfect scenario
filled extra value as "more", and on clicking on the cell, a pop-up appears with another table [as the
value of this key is another object].
